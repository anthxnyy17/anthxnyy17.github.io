## favorite cpsc120 Labs

* Lab 3

  This one of my favorite labs because unfortunately i missed the first two labs due to personal reasons and 
seeing everything about lab 3 is how it got me very interested into coding because it started teaching me a lot about coding 

* Lab 6 part-2

  This was my second favorite lab in cpsc-120L as it helped me understand the game of Blackjack or 21 and how cards work like how all 
face cards count as 10 and an ace can either count as 10 or 1 and how youâ€™re objective is to always try to stay at 21 or below and 
this has helped me learn how to play blackjack in real life with my cousins

* Lab 10

  This is my third favorite lab because in this lab we did it by ourselves since we were assigned it during our thanksgiving break. I liked 
this lab a lot because it helped understand vectors way more than before and it was so cool how we used the vectors to organize California 
counties.
